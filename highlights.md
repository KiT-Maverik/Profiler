# Software Development

- I've developed a comprehensive library of reusable components and utilities. This library enables rapid project initiation, allowing me to deliver a functional prototype in record time. Considering the amount of work put in this library, `I am saving about $30k` for projects starting from scratch.
- I have experience building front-end architecture from scratch.
- I have experience managing a team of 5 people, acting as a team lead.
- I have experience integrating and facilitating code quality practices (Code standards, code reviews, retrospectives).
- I have experience working with complex APIs, in contract-first paradigm.
- I have experience building reusable components and libraries for future use.
- I have experience working with WEB3 (Blockchain) and participating in the development of an NFT marketplace (
  spaceseven.com).
- I have experience working as an architect on a project with heavy MUI usage.
