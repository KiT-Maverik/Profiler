# Philosophy

## AI-driven development

I specialize in leveraging AI to streamline routine processes such as generating commit messages, writing automated
tests, producing documentation, and managing code reviews and pull requests.

I created [custom prompt library](https://gist.github.com/KiT-Maverik), ready for immediate implementation, which can
boost productivity by up to 100%.

## Lightning-fast project start

I identified frequently recurring functionalities across various applications, and developed a comprehensive library
of reusable components and utilities. This library enables rapid project initiation, allowing me to deliver a functional
prototype in record time.

Considering the amount of work put in this library, `I am saving about $30k` for projects starting from scratch.

## Contract-Driven Development

Imagine being able to eliminate guesswork, build trust, and streamline communication across your entire software
delivery pipeline—before a single line of implementation code is written. That’s what contract-driven development brings
to the table.

By defining clear, testable contracts up front, your team aligns instantly on the `what` and `how` of your APIs,
empowering developers, testers, and product managers to work in harmony.
The result? Robust, future-proofed integrations that can adapt gracefully to new business requirements. With
contract-driven development, you’ll deliver high-quality software at a faster pace, keep stakeholders happy, and set
your products apart with a standard of excellence everyone can rely on. In short, it’s not just a methodology—it's a
smarter, more predictable path to success.

## Owner’s Mindset

Having worked in product companies, I treat every line of code like it's part of a product I personally own. From
ideation to user experience, I'm driven to refine, improve, and go the extra mile—ensuring every release meets the
highest standards for both performance and impact.

## Software Development Constitution

I believe nothing fosters efficient collaboration better than a clear, unified ruleset.

I’ve created a `Software Development Constitution` covering coding standards, commit messages, naming conventions,
and PR review guidelines—ensuring every team member aligns on best practices and delivers top-quality results.

## Storybook

I advocate for leveraging the full potential of Storybook's ecosystem.

I specialize in enabling its capabilities across diverse teams, including `design`, `QA`, `management`, `frontend`,
and `backend`. My expertise includes setting up comprehensive environments for early demos, and testing. I craft
components with complete lifecycle support, incorporating variants, themes, and seamless mocked API interactions.

## Alpha testing

I believe early testing based on requirements and designs, conducted in cooperation with design, product, QA,
backend, and frontend teams is essential to the product success. This practice allows finding bugs early in the SDLC,
leading to reduced project costs and improved development efficiency.
